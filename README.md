MATLAB and SIMULINK code relevant to the generation of data and analysis of the thesis "Method and Simulation of On-orbit Sub-microthrust Evaluation".

Note that this simulation requires the installation of the MATLAB Aerospace Toolbox/Blockset, the Curve Fitting Toolbox, and the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

Code is labelled and annotated with respect to its function in the analysis. The optimal micthothruster script doubles as the simulation time script; just modify the for loop to run once when not generating simulation time data.

The "uncertainty_analysis" and "filter_process_analysis" both require existing .mat files to run correctly; run the "Optimal_Microthruster_Script" and the "Filter
